# Surface and Connectivity Reconstruction: Imaging Pipeline for TVB Simulations
## SCRIPTS 0.4
 
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ins-amu/scripts/wiki)

#### NEW in 0.4:
- Dockerfile for easy installation with Docker.
- Tests. 
- Reorganization and simplification of the code => compatibility with tvb-make.
- 4 new parcellations: Destrieux, HCP-MMP1, Yeo7 and Yeo 17.

#### Features
- prepare data for TVB: surface reconstruction, region mapping, connectome.
- mrtrix 3.0 RC2: SIFT/SIFT2, ACT, 3 types of registration structural/diffusion, denoising, topup/eddy corrections, bias field corrections, mask upsampling and dilatation, multi-shell multi-tissue, dhollander algo, fsl subcortical structure parcellation, tractogram and tdi generation, multi-threaded.
- automatic config checks.
- convenience script for HCP datasets.
- handle automatically reverse phase-encoding DWI in most cases.
- subparcellation in any number of regions along with corresponding region mapping.
- MNE forward model.
- python 3.5.
